  <h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>
  JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website
  content, i.e. anything that moves, refreshes, or otherwise changes on your
  screen without requiring you to manually reload a web page. Features like:
  </p>

  animated graphics<br>
  photo slideshows<br>
  autocomplete text suggestions<br>
  interactive forms<br>
  <p>
  An even better way of understanding what JavaScript does is to think about
  certain web features you use every day and likely take for granted—like when
  your Facebook timeline automatically updates on your screen or Google suggests
  search terms based on a few letters you’ve started typing. In both cases,
  that’s JavaScript in action.

  The results of JavaScript may seem simple, but there’s a reason why we teach
  an entire segment on JavaScript in both our Front End Web Developer and Break
  into Tech Blueprints. Underneath all those great animations and
  autocompletes—there’s some pretty fascinating stuff happening. This guide
  will break down exactly how JavaScript works and why and how to use it,
  plus the best ways to learn JavaScript if you’re realizing you need it in your
  skillset.
