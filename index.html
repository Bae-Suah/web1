  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>
  Websites can be used in various fashions: a personal website, a corporate
  website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc.
  Websites can be the work of an individual, a business or other organization,
  and are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose. Any website can
  contain a hyperlink to any other website, so the distinction between individual
  sites, as perceived by the user, can be blurred.

  Some websites require user registration or subscription to access content.
  Examples of subscription websites include many business sites, news websites,
  academic journal websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, message
  boards, web-based email, social networking websites, websites providing
  real-time stock market data, as well as sites providing various other services.
